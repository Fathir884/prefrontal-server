# Prefrontal: The Productivity SuperApp - Official User Manual & Feature Codex

## 1. Introduction: The Neurobiology of Productivity
**Prefrontal** is not merely a collection of tools; it is a digital "Second Brain" designed to augment your Executive Function. The modern world fragments our attention across dozens of applications—one for finance, one for habits, one for calendar, and another for notes. This constant "context switching" carries a heavy cognitive load, burning glucose and lowering functional IQ.

Prefrontal solves this by unifying **Finance, Scheduling, Learning, Wellness, and AI** into a single, cohesive ecosystem. By reducing friction and centralizing data, it allows you to enter a "Flow State" faster and maintain it longer.

## 2. Module 1: Pref AI Intelligence (The Central Nervous System)

### 🧠 Conceptual Overview
Pref AI is the beating heart of the application, powered by **Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro**. Unlike standard chatbots (like ChatGPT) that live in a vacuum, Pref AI has read-access to your local application state (with permission). It "knows" you. It acts as a stoic, rational accountability partner designed to help you make better decisions.

### ✨ Key Features
1.  **Contextual Awareness:** The AI can see your "Vital Signs". If you complain about being tired, it might check your sleep data or task load and suggest a break.
2.  **RAG Engine (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** This turns static documents into interactive dialogues. You can upload complex PDFs (contracts, textbooks, research papers), and the AI will index them, allowing you to ask specific questions about the content.
3.  **The Persona:** Pref AI is prompted to be concise, logical, and encouraging. It avoids fluff and focuses on actionable advice.

### 🛠 Step-by-Step Usage Guide

#### A. Chatting with Context
1.  Tap the **Sparkle/AI Icon** floating button or the "Pref AI" card on the Dashboard.
2.  Type a query like *"I feel overwhelmed today."*
3.  The AI will analyze your pending task count and financial stress levels before replying.
4.  It might respond: *"I see you have 8 high-priority tasks and your spending is high this week. Let's tackle the smallest task first to get a dopamine win."*

#### B. Using the RAG Engine (PDF Analysis)
1.  Inside the Chat interface, tap the **Paperclip Icon** (Attachment).
2.  Select a PDF file from your device storage.
3.  Wait a moment for the "Processing..." indicator to finish.
4.  Once the file appears in the chat bubble, ask a question like: *"Summarize the key arguments of Chapter 3"* or *"What are the legal dates mentioned in this contract?"*
5.  Pref AI will answer specifically based on the document's content.

## 3. Module 2: Home Dashboard (The Command Center)

### 🧠 Conceptual Overview
The Dashboard is designed for "Cognitive Ergonomics". Its goal is to provide maximum situational awareness with minimum visual clutter. It answers the question: *"How am I doing right now?"*

### ✨ Key Features
1.  **Dynamic Greeting:** The app recognizes the time of day and greets you accordingly, often with a stoic quote to ground your mindset.
2.  **Vital Signs Cards:** These are three live data streams:
    *   *Financial Pulse:* Your Net Balance (Income - Expense). Green means surplus, Red means deficit.
    *   *Task Load:* The number of incomplete tasks due today.
    *   *Mental Streak:* How many days in a row you have logged your mood.
3.  **Quick Actions:** A grid of color-coded buttons to jump to specific deep modules without navigation fatigue.

### 🛠 Step-by-Step Usage Guide
1.  **Open the App:** You land here by default.
2.  **Check Vital Signs:** Glance at the top cards. If "Financial Pulse" is Red, you know to be frugal today. If "Task Load" is high (>5), you know to focus on work.
